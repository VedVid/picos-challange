#### What is PICO's Challange?

PICO's Challange is a small game, highly inspired by the classic Chip's Challange. 


#### Why the game is so short?

I created PICO's Challange from scratch in just a couple of days, to *Finally Finish Something*. I do not think I will extend the game further â€“ I plan to reimplement this in Python and then make the game bigger.
Still, thanks to PICO-8, it is very easy to add new levels, especially if one would use only the existing mechanics. The game is released under a very permissive 2-clause BSD license ("FreeBSD Licence") so if you wish, then please feel free to add new levels and features to the PICO's Challange.
